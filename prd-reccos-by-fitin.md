### **1\. Introduction**

**1.1. Overview:**   
Reccos by Fitin is a strategic digital product within the Fitin Club ecosystem (fitin.club). It's designed as a curated, trusted repository of healthy food and beverage products, serving as practical alternatives to everyday dietary items (e.g., bread, ketchup, sweets, snacks). The platform empowers users to easily discover, research, and save healthier options that align with their goals and Fitin Club's philosophy of integrating sustainable health habits seamlessly into their lives.

**1.2. Background:**   
Fitin Club is dedicated to making healthy living accessible and sustainable. A significant challenge for our users and the wider health-conscious community is navigating the complex food market to find genuinely healthy choices. Misleading labels, overwhelming variety, and lack of time hinder progress towards better dietary habits. Reccos by Fitin directly tackles this by providing a clear, searchable, and expert-vetted database of recommended products, simplifying healthier eating choices and complementing Fitin Club's coaching services.

**1.3. Goals:**

* **Business Goals:**

  * Drive organic user acquisition through Search Engine Optimization (SEO) over time.  
  * Increase the overall value proposition of the Fitin Club ecosystem.  
  * (Future Goal): Explore ethical affiliate partnerships for sustainable revenue generation.  
      
* **Product Goals:**  
  * Deliver a comprehensive, accurate, and intuitive search platform for healthy food alternatives.
